    {
        "question": "What is a Purchase Request (PR)?",
        "answer": "A Purchase Request (PR) is a formal request submitted by an office to procure goods or services needed for its operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a PPMP?",
        "answer": "The PPMP (Project Procurement Management Plan) is a detailed plan that outlines the items needed by an office for a specific period, based on its budget and operational needs. It must be approved by the BAC (Bids and Awards Committee) before a PR can be submitted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the PPMP?",
        "answer": "The PPMP helps in planning and managing procurement needs by outlining all items required for a specific period. This ensures that procurement is aligned with budgetary constraints and organizational needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the steps to submit a PR?",
        "answer": "To submit a purchase request, the office prepares a PPMP detailing the items they need. The PPMP is reviewed and approved by the BAC. Once the PPMP is approved, the office can submit a PR for the items listed in the approved PPMP. The PR then goes through the approval process with Budget, Treasury, Mayor, BAC, CGSO, and Accounting."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who approves the PPMP?",
        "answer": "The PPMP is approved by the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC). This ensures that the procurement plan aligns with budgetary constraints and organizational needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if the PPMP is not approved?",
        "answer": "If the PPMP is not approved by the BAC, the office cannot submit a PR using the items on the said PPMP. The office may need to revise the PPMP based on the feedback from the BAC and resubmit it for approval."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does an office know which items to include in their PPMP?",
        "answer": "Offices can include any items they need in their PPMP, provided these items align with their budget and operational requirements."
    },
    {
	    "question": "Can an office request items not listed in the PPMP?",
	    "answer": "No, offices must specify all items they need in their PPMP. Requests for items not included in the PPMP will not be processed."
	},
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the BAC in this process?",
        "answer": "The BAC is responsible for approving PPMPs and ensuring that all procurement activities comply with established policies and regulations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens after the PR is submitted?",
        "answer": "Once the PR is submitted, it goes through a series of approvals, starting with Budget, followed by Treasury, the Mayor, BAC, CGSO, and finally Accounting. Each department reviews the request before granting approval."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who can I contact for help with the process?",
        "answer": "For assistance with the purchase request or PPMP process, please contact your officeâ€™s designated procurement officer or the BAC directly."
